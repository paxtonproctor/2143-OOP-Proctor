## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> In OOP we use Abstraction as a way to hide all the complex and tiny details within a program and make it where
> The user won't get confused. We make it where they have a easy time fixing the system or be able to use the interface easily.
> Example: a light has wires that send electric signals from a switch to a light bulb. but people only need to know how to flip the switch on and off.

#### Attributes
> Classes and Structs have different Attributes such as private, public, etc.
> Example: Students can have a Student ID, Name, Gender, Classes that they take etc.
#### Class
> We can treat a Class like a recipe. It is a way for programmers to write a template like thing that will help create objects in our program
> And we can use these objects in the class constantly once we create them.
> Example: Fridge is the class and the Objects are bananas, Apples, and Oranges. These objects are created within the class.

#### Class Variable
> A variable that is declared in a class. Typically declared inside the private section.
> Example: int x;

#### Composition
> Is a simple object That is used for a complex class. It helps make these complex classes less...complex.
> Example: a battery is used within a phone.

#### Constructor
> It's a member function that initializes objects in a class. C++ automatically implements it within the class.
> Example:  
    // Default constructor
    CircularArrayQue() {
        Container = new int[10];
        init(10);
    }
#### Encapsulation
> Binds data and functions together and creates the idea of hiding stuff like data.
#### Friends
> It gives your class access to another class and lets you use the private and protected variables within that class.
> Example: friend ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const CircularArrayQue &other);

#### Inheritance
>
#### Object


#### Method
