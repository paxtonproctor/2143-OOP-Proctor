## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> In OOP we use Abstraction as a way to hide all the complex and tiny details within a program and make it where
> The user won't get confused. We make it where they have a easy time fixing the system or be able to use the interface easily.
> Example: a light has wires that send electric signals from a switch to a light bulb. but people only need to know how to flip the switch on and off.

#### Attributes
> Classes and Structs have different Attributes such as private, public, etc.
> Example: Students can have a Student ID, Name, Gender, Classes that they take etc.
#### Class
> We can treat a Class like a recipe. It is a way for programmers to write a template like thing that will help create objects in our program
> And we can use these objects in the class constantly once we create them.
> Example: Fridge is the class and the Objects are bananas, Apples, and Oranges. These objects are created within the class.

#### Class Variable
> A variable that is declared in a class. Typically declared inside the private section.
> Example: int x;

#### Composition
> Is a simple object That is used for a complex class. It helps make these complex classes less...complex.
> Example: a battery is used within a phone.

#### Constructor
> It's a member function that initializes objects in a class. C++ automatically implements it within the class.
> Example:  
    // Default constructor
    CircularArrayQue() {
        Container = new int[10];
        init(10);
    }
#### Encapsulation
> Binds data and functions together and creates the idea of hiding stuff like data.
#### Friends
> It gives your class access to another class and lets you use the private and protected variables within that class.
> Example: friend ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const CircularArrayQue &other);

#### Inheritance
> kinda like a "copy" Inheritance is useful in creating a class that has the same attributes as another class while keeping the other class original and without modification.

#### Instance Variable
> They are not static and they are a member variable that creates a separate copy for each object in a class.

#### Member Variable
> They static variables created inside a class either in the private section or public section.

#### Method
> It's the Member Functions inside a class

#### Multiple Inheritance
> It's where you derive more than one class

#### Object
> a object is a data type within a class
> Example: a car is its own object and has its own attributes.

#### Overloading
> A method that lets you use the same functions or operators more than once but with different parameters.

#### Polymorphism
> A way to perform different task.

#### Public / Private / Protected
> Public section contains items that can be used by other classes. Private section contains items that can only be accessed through your class and not any other. Protected section can be accessed by other classes only when using the inheritance.

#### Static
> is a static member that is only initialized once.

#### Virtual
> a function that can be overridden inside a derived class.
